A miscellaneous collection of scripts.

## pp_to_yaml.pl

Convert the output of puppet resource into YAML data suitable for use in Hiera + `create_resources()`.

```
puppet resource yumrepo | pp_to_yaml.pp > yumrepos.yaml
```

Note that this is useful in Puppet 3.x whereas in Puppet 4.x the `--to_yaml` option has been added to `puppet resource`. [ref](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/man/resource.html)
